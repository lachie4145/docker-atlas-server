# Atlas Dedicated Server for Linux/Docker

**IMPORTANT:** This is an initial release intended for testing. I cannot provide support or promise that this solution will work for you.

This Dockerfile has had *very limited* testing. It would be great to get positive feedback, so if this works for you feel free to open an issue to let everyone know. Sharing `ServerGrid.json`'s is also useful, but be sure to sanitize them first.

## Quick Start

* Make sure you have Docker installed on a Linux host
* Clone or download a zip of this repository
* Build the Docker image

        docker build \
        --build-arg UID=$(id -u) --build-arg GID=$(id -g) \
        -t atlas-server .

* Install Atlas Dedicated Server

        docker run --rm -it -v /some/path/atlas-server:/mnt/atlas-server atlas-server

    * This will install the server into the path given and exit. Use this same command to upgrade the server.

* Copy `ServerGrid*` files to `/some/path/atlas-server/ShooterGame/`

* Run Atlas Dedicated Server

        docker run -d -t --name=atlas-server \
        --net=host \
        -v /some/path/atlas-server:/mnt/atlas-server \
        atlas-server start-server \
        "Ocean?ServerX=0?ServerY=0?MaxPlayers=10?ReservedPlayerSlots=5?QueryPort=57555?Port=5755?SeamlessIP=XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX -NoBattlEye -log -server"

    * Make sure to replace the placeholder SeamlessIP with your public IP
    * For debugging purposes I recommend not using `-d -t` but instead using `--rm -it` which will give real-time console output.
    * The above example uses `--net=host`, which means the containers networking stack is the hosts. This is the easiest way to set things up, but by no means the only way.
    * If you do not use `--net=host`, you'll need to expose the ports you're using for the server, plus the SeamlessIP port,`27000` in the above example. Following the example, add these flags to the `docker run...` command: `--expose 5755 --expose 57555 --expose 27000`

* Monitor logs / VNC

    * This container runs a VNC server on port 5920. Use a VNC client to connect to it. Atlas Dedicated Server will throw GUI dialog errors, and this is the only way to see them.
    * Monitor the server console log by running:

            docker logs -f atlas-server

## Support & Contributing

Unfortunately I do not have the time to support each and everyone of you. This is an early-release intended to combine efforts.

If you wish to contribute please open a pull request.

## Known Issues

* This was built and tested with a 1x1 map as such it assumes as much. Redis is started per instance of this container. If you want to use this for more than one tile, it will have to be modified to not run Redis in the `start-server` script.
* I've been unable to start a large 1x1 tile that requires ~22GB or RAM. Wine crashes right around 16GB. Less populated tiles work.
* CentOS (host) was unable to run the image for unknown reasons (perhaps SELinux), however there has been success under Ubuntu 18.04 as well as UnRAID 6.5.3.
